This package was made by Jonathan Westfall from Shatter Fantasy Studio.

This package is for anyone to use without limits.
You can edit, redistribute the edited version, store a copy of the entire thing as you want, and as you want.

No credit is needed for any project using this. To help support the Shatter Fantasy tools for community members all I ask is to share the Git Repos so people can follow there development. 

In the future a discord for the project will be avaliable for anyone to share ideas and help with the code. Anyone who helps with the project will be put in the credits for that repo.
